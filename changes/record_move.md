## Purpose

This agent tracks every file-level change made to the codebase and appends a structured log entry to `change_movements.md`.

## Behavior

When invoked, this agent will:

1. Read the current contents of `change_movements.md` to determine the next entry number.
2. Collect the following information for each change:
   - Entry number (auto-incremented)
   - Date (current date in YYYY-MM-DD format)
   - Action type: `Created`, `Modified`, or `Deleted`
   - File path (relative to project root)
   - Description of what changed and why
3. Append a new entry block to `change_movements.md` using the format below.
4. Never overwrite existing entries — only append.

## Log Entry Format

```
## [N] <Action>: <file path>

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD  
**Action:** Created | Modified | Deleted  
**File:** `<relative file path>`  
**Changes:**
- <bullet describing what changed>
- <bullet describing why it changed>
```

## Log File

`change_movements.md` — located at the project root.
